        <p id="img-caption" class="font">Annelies Marie Frank, better known as Anne Frank, was born in 1929, in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany. Because the family was Jewish, they moved to Amsterdam, the Netherlands soon after Adolf Hitler came to power in 1933. They somehow managed to restore normalcy to their lives in this new country. The family was together and to them that was all that mattered. But even this was shattered in 1940 when Germany invaded the Netherlands and the Nazis started rounding Jews up before sending them to ‘work camps’ in the east. Today we all know what the true nature of these camps were. We know those were not the ‘relocation camps’ that the Nazis claimed they were.
           <br><br>
            The situation kept worsening and in July 1942, when Anne’s elder sister Margot was ordered to report for deportation, the family went into hiding. They were soon joined by four family friends and were helped and protected by a group of loyal non-Jewish friends. Anne started keeping a diary in June 1942 and continued to write entries in hiding, recording not only their day-to-day lives but also pouring out her soul and documenting her innermost feelings, desire to be understood and intention to change the world. Her diary entries reflect her gradual maturity and emotional depth, things she hid behind a chirpy and talkative exterior because those around her failed to appreciate her for who she was.

        <u1 class="font" style="text-align: justify;">
            <br>
            <l1><b>1929</b>-Annelies Marie Frank was born to Otto and
                Edith Frank in Frankfurt am Main, Germany</l1>
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1933</b>- The Frank family lived in Germany. Hitler
                was now the most powerful leader in their
                country.
                </l1>
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1933</b>-In summer 1933, worried about the Nazi persecution of German Jews,
                Otto Frank traveled to Amsterdam.
                 With the help of his brother-in-law, he opened a branch of Opetka, a
                company that manufactured products used in making jam.
                 In December, after finding an apartment, Edith and Margot joined
                Otto in Amsterdam. Anne stayed with her grandmother until February
                1934, when she reunited with her family in the Netherlands.
                </l1>   
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1935</b>-The Nuremberg Race Laws set a legal
                definition for which people the German
                government considered to be “Jewish.”
                 Under the laws, German Jews lost their
                citizenship and were also forbidden from
                entering into relationships with non-Jews.
                The Frank family was exempted from these
                laws since the four of them did not live in
                Germany, and they were able to keep their
                German citizenship.
            </l1>  
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1938</b>-In 1938, Otto Frank traveled to Rotterdam to
                register his family to immigrate to the United
                States.
                The United States restricted the number of people
                born in each country who could immigrate each
                year. The Frank family registered for the German
                waiting list because they had all been born in
                Germany.
                 By January 1939, more than 300,000 Germans
                had applied for US immigration visas.</l1>
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1938</b>- Nazi supporters launched a coordinated and
                violent attack against Jews in the areas controlled
                by Germany.
                They burned hundreds of synagogues, destroyed
                stores and homes owned by Jewish families, and
                arrested 30,000 Jewish men and boys who were
                then imprisoned in concentration camps—
                including Anne Frank’s uncles, Walter and Julius
                Hollander.</l1>
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1939</b>-Nazi Germany invaded Poland. Great
                Britain and France, which had an alliance
                with Poland, declared war on Germany.
                World War II officially began.</l1>
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1940</b>-The German military invaded and
                occupied the Netherlands, Belgium, and
                Luxembourg. They also invaded France,
                dividing it into Nazi-occupied and
                Nazi-aligned zones.
                In the attack, German air forces
                destroyed the US consulate in
                Rotterdam, where the Frank family had
                registered for US immigration. Any
                paperwork on file for their visas was
                destroyed.</l1>   
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1941</b>-Otto Frank wrote to his college friend, Nathan Straus, Jr,
                in the United States, asking for help obtaining a US
                immigration visa. He wrote, “I am forced to look out for
                emigration and as far as I can see USA is the only
                country we could go to.”
                Before Straus could compile the necessary paperwork,
                all American consulates in Nazi-occupied
                Europe--including in the Netherlands--closed. Otto Frank
                wrote to Straus, “Bad luck, but cannot be helped. Let us
                hope that conditions will get more normal again.”</l1> 
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1941</b>-The “Eleventh Decree to the Law on the
                Citizenship of the Reich” stated that all
                German Jews living outside of Germany
                were no longer citizens of Germany.
                Although the Frank family had moved to
                Amsterdam in 1933, the Franks had never
                become Dutch citizens. After this law, they
                officially became “stateless” and were not
                legally citizens of any country</l1> 
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1942</b>-Johann Rauter, the head of the SS in the
                Nazi-occupied Netherlands, ordered all
                Jews in the Netherlands to visibly wear a
                “Jewish star” when in public.
                 Cloth yellow stars, marked with the word
                “Jood” [meaning “Jew” in Dutch], and
                manufactured in the Łódź ghetto in
                Nazi-occupied Poland, were distributed to
                Jewish households. </l1> 
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1942</b>-On Anne Frank’s 13th birthday, she
                received a diary, which she had chosen
                from a shop window as her birthday
                present.
                 She wrote, “I hope I will be able to
                confide everything to you...and I hope
                you will be a great source of comfort and
                support.”
                </l1>
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1942</b>-On July 5, 1942, Margot Frank received a
                call-up notice ordering her to report for a
                “German work camp.” The next morning,
                after leaving clues that they had escaped to
                Switzerland, the Frank family went into
                hiding in an annex above the Opetka
                offices at 263 Prinsengracht.
                Otto’s business partner and friend
                Hermann van Pels, along with his wife,
                Auguste, and son, Peter, joined the Franks
                one week later. (Anne calls them the van
                Daans in her diary.) </l1>
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1944</b>-After hearing on the radio that the
                Dutch government hoped to collect
                diaries and recollections of people
                living in the Netherlands during the
                war, Anne began rewriting her diaries.
                She went back to the beginning and
                rewrote entries, adding additional
                details and context in case her diary
                was ever read by others.</l1>
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1944</b>-In late morning, Dutch police entered the “Secret
                Annex” and arrested the Frank family, the van Pels
                family, and Fritz Pfeffer, as well as Johannes
                Kleiman and Victor Kugler, who worked at Opetka
                and had been helping to hide the residents.
                Historians do not know whether the residents were
                betrayed by someone who learned they were
                hiding above the offices, or if the residents were
                discovered accidentally while the police were
                looking for other illegal activity in the Opetka
                offices. </l1>
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1944</b>-After several days in police custody in
                Amsterdam, the eight residents of the
                “Secret Annex” were deported by train to
                Westerbork, a large transit camp in the
                Netherlands. There, they were placed in a
                punishment barrack, since they had
                participated in a criminal act (going into
                hiding.)
                Anne, Margot, and Edith were kept
                together and forced to work repurposing
                components of batteries</l1>
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1945</b>-A typhus epidemic swept through
                Bergen-Belsen. The camp had been
                built to house only a few thousand
                prisoners but by early 1945, it held
                more than 60,000.
                Margot died of the disease in late
                February 1945. She was 19 years old.
                 Anne died several days later at age 15.
                They were buried in a mass grave.</l1>
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1945</b>-After physically recovering from his
                experiences at Auschwitz, Otto Frank
                returned to Amsterdam and reunited with
                the Opetka staff. 
                Miep Gies had rescued Anne’s diary after the
                family’s arrest, and gave Otto Frank the
                pages. Otto resisted reading his
                daughter’s diary until it became clear that
                Anne had not survived the Holocaust.</l1>
            <br><br>
            <l1><b>1947</b>-Just over five years after Anne began writing her
                diary, Het Achterhuis was published in the
                Netherlands. It was published in French and
                German in 1950 and in English in 1952.
                Since 1947, Anne Frank’s diary has been
                published in more than 70 languages.
